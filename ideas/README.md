Yes, you can force your game to use a specific Ethernet adapter for streaming. One common method is to use a tool called **ForceBindIP**. This tool allows you to bind a specific application to a particular network adapter. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Steps to Use ForceBindIP

1. **Download and Install ForceBindIP**:
   - You can download ForceBindIP from [here](https://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip).

2. **Find the IP Address of Your Ethernet Adapter**:
   - Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`.
   - Note the IP address of the Ethernet adapter you want to use.

3. **Create a Shortcut or Batch File**:
   - You can create a shortcut or a batch file to launch your game with ForceBindIP.
   - For a shortcut:
     1. Right-click on your desktop and select **New > Shortcut**.
     2. Enter the following in the location field:
       ```plaintext
       "C:\Path\To\ForceBindIP.exe" 192.168.1.100 "C:\Path\To\YourGame.exe"
       ```
       Replace `192.168.1.100` with the IP address of your Ethernet adapter and adjust the paths accordingly.
     3. Click **Next**, name your shortcut, and click **Finish**.

   - For a batch file:
     1. Open Notepad and enter the following:
       ```batch
       @echo off
       "C:\Path\To\ForceBindIP.exe" 192.168.1.100 "C:\Path\To\YourGame.exe"
       ```
     2. Save the file with a `.bat` extension.

4. **Run the Game**:
   - Use the shortcut or batch file to launch your game. This will force the game to use the specified Ethernet adapter.

### Example Batch File
Here’s an example batch file for clarity:

```batch
@echo off
"C:\Program Files (x86)\ForceBindIP\ForceBindIP.exe" 192.168.1.100 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\YourGame\YourGame.exe"
```

This method ensures that your game uses the specified Ethernet adapter for streaming¹².
