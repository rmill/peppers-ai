To hide all boot text and play an MP4 during the boot process on a Raspberry Pi, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Hide Boot Text
You need to edit the `cmdline.txt` file to suppress the boot messages.

1. Open the `cmdline.txt` file:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
    ```

2. Modify the file to include the following parameters:
    ```text
    console=tty3 loglevel=3 quiet logo.nologo vt.global_cursor_default=0
    ```
    Ensure all parameters are on a single line.

### 2. Play an MP4 During Boot
You can use a service to play the MP4 file during boot. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Install `omxplayer`** if it’s not already installed:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install omxplayer
    ```

2. **Create a systemd service** to play the MP4:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/playvideo.service
    ```

3. Add the following content to the file:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Play MP4 on boot
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/omxplayer /path/to/your/video.mp4
    StandardOutput=null
    StandardError=null
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

4. **Enable the service**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable playvideo.service
    ```

5. **Reboot your Raspberry Pi**:
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

This setup will hide the boot text and play your specified MP4 file during the boot process¹³.
