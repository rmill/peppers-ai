Yes, you can detect if Steam Link has been configured on a Raspberry Pi by checking for the presence of its configuration files and verifying if the Steam Link service is running. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Check for Configuration Files
Steam Link typically stores its configuration files in the home directory. You can look for these files to confirm if Steam Link has been set up.

1. **Open Terminal** on your Raspberry Pi.
2. **List the contents** of the Steam Link configuration directory:
    ```bash
    ls ~/.local/share/SteamLink
    ```

If you see files like `config.json` or other related files, Steam Link has likely been configured.

### 2. Check if the Steam Link Service is Running
You can check if the Steam Link service is running using the `ps` command.

1. **Open Terminal** on your Raspberry Pi.
2. **Run the following command** to check for the Steam Link process:
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep steamlink
    ```

If you see a process related to `steamlink`, it indicates that Steam Link is running.

### 3. Create a Script to Automate the Check
You can create a script to automate the detection process. Here’s an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for Steam Link configuration files
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/share/SteamLink" ]; then
    echo "Steam Link configuration found."
else
    echo "Steam Link configuration not found."
fi

# Check if Steam Link service is running
if pgrep -x "steamlink" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Steam Link is running."
else
    echo "Steam Link is not running."
fi
```

Save this script as `check_steamlink.sh`, make it executable, and run it:

```bash
chmod +x check_steamlink.sh
./check_steamlink.sh
```

This script will check for the presence of Steam Link configuration files and whether the Steam Link service is running¹².
