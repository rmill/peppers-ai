Yes, you can set up your Raspberry Pi to run Steam Link and display a GIF or MP4 until a game is being streamed. Here’s a general approach to achieve this:

1. **Install Steam Link**: First, ensure Steam Link is installed on your Raspberry Pi. You can follow guides like the one on [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/steam-link-raspberry-pi) for detailed steps².

2. **Create a Script**: You’ll need a script to handle the display of the GIF or MP4 and to launch Steam Link when a game starts streaming.

3. **Use a Media Player**: Use a media player like `omxplayer` or `vlc` to display the GIF or MP4.

4. **Monitor Steam Link Status**: You can monitor the status of Steam Link to know when to switch from the GIF/MP4 to the game stream.

Here’s an example script using `bash`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to your GIF or MP4
MEDIA_FILE="/path/to/your/media/file.mp4"

# Function to play the media file
play_media() {
    omxplayer --loop $MEDIA_FILE &
    MEDIA_PID=$!
}

# Function to stop the media player
stop_media() {
    kill $MEDIA_PID
}

# Start playing the media file
play_media

# Launch Steam Link
steamlink &

# Monitor Steam Link status
while true; do
    if pgrep -x "steamlink" > /dev/null; then
        stop_media
        break
    fi
    sleep 1
done
```

This script will loop the media file until Steam Link starts. Adjust the paths and commands as needed for your setup.
